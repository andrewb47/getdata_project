#### Introduction
This document modifies and updates the codebook information provided with the original data and defines the variables used, summaries, other processing and any other relevant information.

A description of the working of the R scripts is provided in the [README] [readme]. The [Original README] [iwaal] provided with the source data is provided for reference. Relevant data from it is included in this document.

#### The original data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The captured dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected
for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
